# DSPT - Duper's Stoneworks Portals Tool

Wowowow another mod! I can't believe this one, it can make portals :O

## Commands

The mod introduces the following commands:

*   `/portal <xPortal> <yPortal> <zPortal> <xDestine> <yDestine> <zDestine> <expireTime>`
    *   Creates a portal at the specified `(xPortal, yPortal, zPortal)` coordinates.
    *   Sets the portal's destination to `(xDestine, yDestine, zDestine)`.
    *   The portal will be active for `expireTime` seconds.

*   `/qportal`
    *   Creates a "quick" portal 3 blocks in front of the player.
    *   This portal lasts for 3 seconds.
    *   The destination for this portal is set using the `/setqportal` command or by the last `/portal` command.

*   `/setqportal <x> <y> <z>`
    *   Sets the destination coordinates for the `/qportal` command.
    *   The destination is saved to `dset_client_config.properties` in the Minecraft config directory.

## Configuration

The destination for the `/qportal` command is stored in a configuration file named `dset_client_config.properties` located in your Minecraft instance's `config` directory. This file is automatically created and updated when you use the `/setqportal` command or the `/portal` command.

The configuration stores the following properties:
*   `xDestine`: The X-coordinate of the quick portal destination.
*   `yDestine`: The Y-coordinate of the quick portal destination.
*   `zDestine`: The Z-coordinate of the quick portal destination.

## How it Works

When a portal is created using `/portal` or `/qportal`, orange area effect clouds appear to visualize the portal. The mod then checks if any player enters the bounding box of an active portal. If a player enters, and they are not on teleport cooldown (2 seconds), they will be teleported to the portal's destination using the `/tp` command. The `ConfigManager` class handles loading and saving the destination coordinates for the quick portal.
